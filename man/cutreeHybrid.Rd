\arguments{
  \item{dendro}{a hierarchical clustering dendorgram such as one returned by \code{hclust}.  }

  \item{distM}{Distance matrix that was used as input to \code{hclust}.  }

  \item{cutHeight}{Maximum joining heights that will be considered. It defaults to 99% 
of the range between the 5th percentile and the maximum of the joining heights on the dendrogram.  }

  \item{minClusterSize}{Minimum cluster size.  }

  \item{deepSplit}{Either logical or integer in the range 0 to 4. Provides a rough control over 
sensitivity to cluster splitting. The higher the value, the more and smaller clusters will be produced. 
A finer control can be achieved via \code{maxBranchCor}, \code{minBranchSplit}, 
\code{maxCoreScatter} and \code{minGap} below.}

  \item{maxCoreScatter}{ Maximum scatter of the core for a branch to be a cluster, given as the fraction
of \code{cutHeight} relative to the 5th percentile of joining heights. See Details.  } 

  \item{minGap}{Minimum cluster gap given as the fraction of the difference between \code{cutHeight} and
the 5th percentile of joining heights.  }

  \item{maxAbsCoreScatter}{Maximum scatter of the core for a branch to be a cluster given as absolute
heights. If given, overrides \code{maxCoreScatter}.  }

  \item{minAbsGap}{ Minimum cluster gap given as absolute height difference. If given, overrides
\code{minGap}.  } 

  \item{minSplitHeight}{Minimum split height given as the fraction of the difference between
\code{cutHeight} and the 5th percentile of joining heights. Branches merging below this height will
automatically be merged. Defaults to zero but is used only if \code{minAbsSplitHeight} below is \code{NULL}.}

  \item{minAbsSplitHeight}{Minimum split height given as an absolute height.
Branches merging below this height will automatically be merged. If not given (default), will be determined
from \code{minSplitHeight} above.}

  \item{externalBranchSplitFnc}{Optional function to evaluate split (dissimilarity) between two branches.
Either a single function or a list in which each component is a function (see
\code{assumeSimpleExternalSpecification} below for how to specify a single function).
Each function can be specified by name (a character string) or the actual function object.
Each given function must take arguments \code{branch1} and \code{branch2} that specify the
indices of objects in
the two branches whose dissimilarity is to be evaluated, and possibly other arguments. It must return a
number that quantifies the dissimilarity of the two branches. The returned value will be compared to
\code{minExternalSplit} (see below). This argument is only used for  method "hybrid".}

  \item{minExternalSplit}{Thresholds to decide whether two branches should be merged. 
It should be a numeric vector of the same length as the number of functions in
\code{externalBranchSplitFnc} above. 
Only used for method "hybrid". }

  \item{externalSplitOptions}{Further arguments to function \code{externalBranchSplitFnc}. If only one 
external function is specified in \code{externalBranchSplitFnc} above, \code{externalSplitOptions} 
can be a named
list of arguments or a list with one component that is in turn  the named list of further arguments for
\code{externalBranchSplitFnc[[1]]}. The argument \code{assumeSimpleExternalSpecification} controls which of 
the two possibilities should be assumed. If multiple functions are specified in
\code{externalBranchSplitFnc},
\code{externalSplitOptions}
must be a list in which each component is a named list giving the further arguments for the corresponding 
function in  \code{externalBranchSplitFnc}. Only used for method "hybrid".}

  \item{externalSplitFncNeedsDistance}{Optional specification of whether the external branch split
functions need the distance matrix as one of their arguments. Either \code{NULL} or a logical vector with
one element per branch split function  that specifies whether the corresponding branch split function
expects the distance matrix as one of its arguments. The default \code{NULL} is interpreted as a vector of
\code{TRUE}. When dealing with a large number of objects, setting this argument to \code{FALSE} whenever
possible can prevent unnecessary memory utilization.}

  \item{assumeSimpleExternalSpecification}{Logical: when \code{minExternalSplit} above is a scalar (has
length 1), should the function assume a simple specification of \code{externalBranchSplitFnc} and
\code{externalSplitOptions}? If \code{TRUE}, \code{externalBranchSplitFnc} is taken as the function
specification and \code{externalSplitOptions} the named list of options. This is suitable for simple direct
calls of this function. If \code{FALSE}, \code{externalBranchSplitFnc} is assumed to be a list with a
single component which specifies the function, and \code{externalSplitOptions} is a list with one
component that is in turn the named list of further arguments for \code{externalBranchSplitFnc[[1]]}.}

  \item{pamStage}{Logical, only used for method "hybrid".  If \code{TRUE}, the second (PAM-like) stage will be performed.
}    

  \item{pamRespectsDendro}{Logical, only used for method "hybrid". 
  If \code{TRUE}, the PAM stage will
respect the dendrogram in the sense an object can be PAM-assigned only to clusters that lie below it on 
the branch that the object is merged into.
     See \code{\link[dynamicTreeCut]{cutreeDynamic}} for more details. }

  \item{useMedoids}{if TRUE, the second stage will be use object to medoid distance; if FALSE, it
  will use average object to cluster distance. The default (FALSE) is recommended. }

  \item{maxPamDist}{Maximum object distance to closest cluster that will result in the object
assigned to that cluster. Defaults to \code{cutHeight}. }

  \item{respectSmallClusters}{If TRUE, branches that failed to be clusters in stage 1 only because of
insufficient size will be assigned together in stage 2. If FALSE, all objects will be assigned
individually.}

  \item{verbose}{Controls the verbosity of the output. 0 will make the function completely quiet,
values up to 4 gradually increase verbosity.}

  \item{indent}{Controls indentation of printed messages (see \code{verbose} above). Each unit
adds two spaces before printed messages; useful when several functions' output is to be nested. } 
}
\details{
  The function detects clusters in a hierarchical dendrogram based on the shape of branches on the
dendrogram. For details on the method, see
\url{http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/BranchCutting}.

  In order to make the shape parameters \code{maxCoreScatter} and \code{minGap} more universal, their
values are interpreted relative to \code{cutHeight} and the 5th percetile of the merging heights (we
arbitrarily chose the 5th percetile rather than the minimum for reasons of stability). Thus, the absolute
maximum allowable core scatter is calculated as \code{maxCoreScatter * (cutHeight - refHeight) +
refHeight} and the absolute minimum allowable gap as \code{minGap * (cutHeight - refHeight)}, where
\code{refHeight} is the 5th percentile of the merging heights.

}
\value{
  A list containg the following elements:
  \item{labels}{Numerical labels of clusters, with 0 meaning unassigned, label 1 labeling the largest
                cluster etc.  }

  \item{cores}{Numerical labels indicating cores of found clusters.  }

  \item{smallLabels}{Numerical labels for branches that failed to be recognized clusters only
because of insufficient number of objects.}

  \item{mergeDiagnostics}{A data.frame with one row  per merge in the input dendrogram. The columns give the
values of the various merging criteria used by the algorithm. Missing data indicate that at least one of the
"branches" merged was actually a singleton (single node) and hence the branch merging was automatic. }

  \item{mergeCriteria}{Values of the merging thresholds. Either a copy of the corresponding input thresholds
or values determined by \code{deepSplit}. }

  \item{branches}{A list detailing the deteced branch structure.  }
